              Beck is fun and extremely varied in his musical style. I only have
              a few songs from him but they are pretty different.

              Timber Timbre is one of my all time favorite bands. I discovered
              them years ago by going to a tiny show at a bar/venue in town
              (back when I used to leave the house because I was in my 20s), and
              they blew me away.
            </p>
            <p>
              My friend had given me my first record player during this time,
              and I bought one of my first records at the Timber Timbre show. It
              was one of their earlier albums, and was absolutely fantastic. I
              used to sit in my tiny studio apartment in Old Louisville with my
              dog Lucy, and we’d just listen to the album together over and
              over. I had just inherited Lucy from mom and dad (they were moving
              to their condo and didn’t have room for her anymore) and we were
              still getting to know each other. I would sing to her and she
              loved it. It was the very beginning of our relationship, which
              ended up being one of the most special relationships of my life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Anyway, they are *extremely* versatile. Their early stuff is kind
              of bluegrass/folk, and then they get progressively weirder with
              each album. They kind of have a weird “spaghetti western” vibe
              with some of their music. I’m not sure how to categorize them if
              I’m being honest.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you end up liking this song, let me know. I have already have a
              great Timber Timbre playlist that highlights evolution of their
              music. Highly recommend.

              I worked at local ad agency (called Mightily) from 2018 - 2020.
              The office was huge and super cool and sexy. I would occasionally
              have hypomanic episodes that kept me from sleeping, so I would go
              to the office at like 5am to work. Since there was no one there
              but me, I could connect to the office-wide speakers and play
              whatever I wanted. I was newly obsessed with this song so I would
              just blast it on repeat for hours while I coded. The office was in
              a super old building in the heart of downtown, and the acoustics
              in the space were great. This song would echo around the space so
              beautifully.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was a really nice time in my life and listening to it reminds
              me of that time. It’s still a favorite of mine.
            </p>
            <p>
              Anyway, I know absolutely nothing about the song or the band lol.
              The lyrics make *zero* sense, so you can basically say anything
              when you’re singing along and it still works.

              I only have one Spoon album but it has *many* awesome songs. I
              haven’t listened to any of there more recent stuff because I’m
              currently in a “moody electronic music” phase.

              Ahhhhhhh I love this song and this band so much! They are SO
              weird. Just a cacophony of instruments that somehow work really
              well. I have two of their albums and they are absolutely stellar.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was listening to this album when I was in art school. Great
              vibes. Great memories.

              I found this song on instagram a few months ago and I just think
              it’s so cool. I haven’t listened to any of her other music, but I
              have plans to. Apparently she is a popular Austrian artist. Love
              it.

              This song might be a little too “electronic” for your tastes, but
              it’s a modern classic so I wanted to share it just in case you
              like it.

              This song also might be a little too “electronic”, but it’s
              another modern classic so I couldn’t help myself.

              Neutral Milk Hotel came together in the late 90’s, made an
              absolutely *legendary* album, and then fell apart.
            </p>
            <p>
              I had a close friend who went to the Berklee College of Music in
              Boston, and he would tell me stories about this album and how
              incredible the music was for various reasons. Apparently this
              album was historically important and ended up hugely influencing a
              ton of artists after.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have not fact-checked this, but I remember hearing that the lead
              singer had some sort of episode and basically wrote most of the
              album while he was freaking out in a closet. Whether it’s true or
              not, it illustrates the general vibes around the record. Like some
              sort of extremely romanticized psychotic genius or something.
              Hopefully this is painting a picture of how much the music world
              freaked out about this album.
            </p>
            <p>
              This song in particular is an absolute masterpiece. It’s all about
              the lyrics. My Berklee friend told me that he had several
              classmates that wrote thesis papers on this song.

              I know nothing about this artist except that she’s from Iceland. I
              discovered this on album on Remote Year when I was in Budapest.
              Our apartment (and most apartments) didn’t have AC, and it was
              absolutely unreal how hot it was. I would lay on my bed on top of
              the sheets and listen to this album and just sweat.

              So this artist made a single album, recorded in her home in the
              70s. No one heard it until her son lent a copy to someone at a
              record label in 2004. They released it in 2005, and it’s
              absolutely beautiful.
